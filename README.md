I found this little 3D engine "similar" to the "Descent" game engine, several years ago in a forum of the extinct QB64, but it was not until today that I decided to convert to FreeBasic.

Based on an idea of the author of "Duke Nukem", Ken Silverman called "CUBES5" ( http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm ), but with an extra degree of movement (6DOF) and now called CUBES6 instead of CUBES5.

I have converted it as much as possible to FB with the use of OpenGL.
The mouse movement is not perfect, it has some glitches, but it does the job.
I have changed the keys of the real time editing mode of blocks and textures, to accommodate my taste, but it is easy to adapt.

I make use of the "consoleprint" and "createtext" routines taken from https://www.freebasic.net/forum/  with some small changes needed. (D.J.Peters)
